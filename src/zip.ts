// The zip function matches the first element of the first array

// the second element of the first array with the second element
// of the second array, and so on.
// If the arrays are of different lengths, the remaining elements of
// the longer array are ignored.

// It is used to combine multiple arrays into a single array of tuples.
// Its is often useful when working with data from multiple sources that
// need to be combined or correlated.
// It is also useful when working with data that is in a tabular format.
// Also, useful when you want to iterate over multiple arrays in parallel.

// Define the arrays that contain the coordinates
const xCoordinates = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const yCoordinates = [5, 6, 7, 8];
const zCoordinates = [3, 6, 1, 7];

// Create a zipped array of points
const points = zip(xCoordinates, yCoordinates, zCoordinates);

// Use the zipped array of points
console.log(points);
// => [[1, 5, 3], [2, 6, 6], [3, 7, 1], [4, 8, 7]]
